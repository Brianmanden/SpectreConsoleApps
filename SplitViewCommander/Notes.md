# Split View Commander

## My take on a two panel file commander using [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/)

### Work In Progess :)

* 2023-10-10 Refactored main program. Worked on sets of styles (WIP)
* 2023-10-04 Some images have been added to the Assets folder for inspiration on which features to implement.

### Feature (wish-)list

* Menu in top panel
	* Which menu items ?
* Two panels (vertical split) with different view modes available
	* Short view - filename.ext
	* Long view - filename.ext + various info for each file
	* Preview - open associated program
* "Action buttons" in bottom panel
	* Which buttons ?
		* [View] [Edit] [Copy] [Move/Rename] [Make Folder] [Delete file/folder] [Exit SVC]
